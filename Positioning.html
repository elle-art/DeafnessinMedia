      <h2>Positioning of Deafness</h2>      
        <p>Positioning assumes a <b>social</b> model of deafness. The social model is defined on the behavior of hearing people towards Deaf people.</p>

      <img src="icons/inspiration.png" alt="Inspiration symbol">
      <div id="text4">
        <h3>Inspiration</h3>
        <p>Deaf people are seen as inspiring to hearing people. While it's positive thinking, it is demeaning to view deaf people (or any people) in this way.</p>
      </div>
      <div id = "phrase">
        <h4>Phrases: </h4>
        <p>o	"Deaf people are amazing because ASL is so pretty"</p>
        <p>o	"Their speech is so good."</p>
        <p>o	"Did you see that baby video when they got their implant?"</p>
      </div>

      <img src="icons/exclusion.png" alt="Exclusion symbol"> 
      <div id="text4">
        <h3>Exclusion</h3>
        <p>Deaf people are excluded by hearing people by being unable to participate in everyday activities or can only attend specific activities in isolation. Lack of accessibility(No interpretors, no captions for videos, etc.) is a form of exclusion. 
        Access is made for the hearing people to access Deaf, but not Deaf to access hearing</p>
      </div>
      <div id = "phrase">
        <h4>Phrases: </h4>
          <p>o	"Did you see those really cool sign language gloves??!"</p>
          <p>o	"ASL is provided to hearing HS students.  Deaf children do not learn ASL."</p>
      </div>

      <img src="icons/pity.png" alt="Pity symbol">
      <div id="text4">
        <h3>Pity</h3>
        <p>Deaf people are viewed with pity because they "have it so hard". Not only is it belittliting to be treated this way, but it also shows a lack of understanding of life for a deaf person. Socially, deafness is only a disability if proper accessibility to language is not provided. Living with different circumstances does not implore pity.</p>
      </div>
      <div id = "phrase">
        <h4>Phrases: </h4>
        <p>o	"I couldn’t imagine life without music."</p>
        <p>o	"I would die of boredom without audiobooks in the car."</p>
        <p>o	"It must be so hard to not drive…"</p>
      </div>

      <img src="icons/inclusion.png" alt="Inclusion symbol">
      <div id="text4">
        <h3>Inclusion</h3>
        <p>Deaf people are considered full members of a diverse society. We do not have to invent for Deaf people, we need to pay attention to what they have already said works. Hearing people are inclusive.</p>
      </div>
      <div id = "phrase">
        <h4>Phrases: </h4>
        <p>o	"I must not communicate <b>over</b> a Deaf person’s rights, but find a way to make those statements known"</p>
        <p>o	"I should automatically provide access where I can."</p>
