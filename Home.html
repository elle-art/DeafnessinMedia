			<h2>The Importance of Inclusivity</h2>
				<p> Inclusivity is a fundamental right for deaf people, and it is crucial to ensure that they are not excluded from society. Inclusive practices create an environment where deaf individuals can thrive and achieve their full potential without facing discrimination or barriers. Inclusive education provides access to qualified teachers, inclusive curriculum, and appropriate accommodations to meet their needs, ensuring equal opportunities for learning. Inclusive employment practices provide access to job postings, interviews, and workplace accommodations, allowing deaf individuals to work in an inclusive and safe environment. Social inclusion ensures that deaf people are not excluded from public spaces, events, and social activities. It is essential to promote inclusivity to break down social stigmas and barriers and foster a more welcoming and diverse society that values and respects the contributions of all individuals, including those who are deaf.
